# Sidecar Failure Modes

This document defines expected behavior for the PII-Shield sidecar file mode.

PII-Shield sidecar file mode watches a configured application log file, sanitizes each line, and writes sanitized output to the sidecar `stdout`. Downstream log collectors should ingest the sidecar output, not the original application log file.

## Failure Policy

`PII_FAIL_POLICY` controls behavior when line processing fails.

| Value | Behavior | Recommended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open` | Keep log flow alive where possible. If processing panics, emit the original line. | Availability-first environments. |
| `closed` | Drop failed lines and emit a marker instead. | Compliance-sensitive environments where leaking raw logs is worse than losing a line. |

Default: `open`.

For production compliance rollouts, prefer `PII_FAIL_POLICY=closed` after validating that alerting catches sanitizer errors and dropped lines.

## Sidecar Process Crash

Expected behavior:

- Kubernetes restarts the sidecar according to pod restart behavior.
- Lines written while the sidecar is down may be missed unless the application log file still contains them and the sidecar reopens from a readable position.
- Downstream log volume may drop while the sidecar is unavailable.

Required production controls:

- Alert on sidecar restarts.
- Alert on missing processed bytes.
- Validate restart behavior in staging.
- Keep rollback instructions available for removing injection labels or rolling back Helm values.

## Backpressure

Expected behavior:

- The sidecar reads and processes lines from the watched file.
- If log production exceeds sanitizer throughput, downstream sanitized output can lag.
- High CPU pressure, very broad custom regex rules, or large log lines can increase latency.

Required production controls:

- Set resource requests and limits intentionally.
- Alert on high `piishield_processing_duration_seconds` p95.
- Benchmark representative logs before rollout.
- Avoid broad custom regex rules in high-throughput workloads.

## Large Or Truncated Lines

Expected behavior:

- Standard stdin mode uses a scanner buffer with an upper bound.
- Oversized lines trigger buffer overflow handling.
- In fail-open mode, PII-Shield emits a warning marker.
- In fail-closed mode, PII-Shield emits a drop marker.

Markers:

```text
[PII_SHIELD_WARN: BUFFER_OVERFLOW, STREAM_BROKEN]
[PII_SHIELD_DROP: BUFFER_OVERFLOW]
```

Required production controls:

- Keep maximum log line sizes reasonable.
- Add tests for application logs that may exceed normal line sizes.
- Alert on sanitizer errors.

## File Rotation

Expected behavior:

- File mode uses tailing with reopen enabled.
- The sidecar is expected to continue after common file rotation patterns.
- Rotation behavior still depends on how the application and runtime rotate files.

Required production controls:

- Validate rotation behavior for each workload.
- Confirm rotated files do not bypass sanitized output.
- Confirm log collectors ingest sidecar output only.

## Disk Pressure

Expected behavior:

- PII-Shield does not own the application log file lifecycle.
- Disk pressure can affect the application, shared volume, and sidecar together.
- Missing or truncated source logs can lead to missing sanitized output.

Required production controls:

- Monitor pod/container disk pressure.
- Keep log rotation and retention bounded.
- Validate behavior under synthetic disk pressure before broad rollout.

## Fail-Open And Fail-Closed Selection

Use fail-open when:

- application availability is more important than strict log-loss control;
- logs are not the only compliance control;
- the deployment is still in staging or early controlled rollout.

Use fail-closed when:

- raw log leakage is unacceptable;
- dropped log lines are preferable to unsanitized output;
- alerting and incident response are ready.

## Test Coverage Expectations

Minimum test coverage for production-hardening:

- [x] fail-open buffer overflow behavior;
- [x] fail-closed buffer overflow behavior;
- [ ] file rotation behavior;
- [ ] sidecar restart behavior;
- [ ] application restart behavior;
- [ ] disk pressure behavior;
- [ ] downstream collector bypass checks.
