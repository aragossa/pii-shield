# PII-Shield 🛡️

**Zero-code log sanitization sidecar for Kubernetes.**
Prevents data leaks (GDPR/SOC2) by redacting PII from logs *before* they leave the pod.

## Why PII-Shield?

Developers often forget to mask sensitive data. Traditional regex filters in Fluentd/Logstash are slow, hard to maintain, and consume expensive CPU on log aggregators.

**PII-Shield sits right next to your app container:**
- **High Throughput:** Processes over 100k log lines per second (parallel) with low latency (~0.02ms per line).
- **Context-Aware Entropy Analysis:** Detected high-entropy secrets even without keys (e.g. `Error: ... 44saCk9...`) by analyzing context keywords.
- **100% Accuracy:** Verified against "Wild" stress tests including binary garbage, JSON nesting, and multilingual logs.
- **Deterministic Hashing:** Replaces secrets with unique hashes (e.g., `[HIDDEN:a1b2c]`), allowing QA to correlate errors without seeing the raw data.
- **Drop-in:** No code changes required. Works with any language (Node, Python, Java, Go).

## Performance Considerations

While PII-Shield is highly optimized, deep inspection of JSON logs (`{"key": "value"}`) requires parsing and re-serialization, which is CPU-intensive compared to simple text scanning.
- **Text Logs:** Extremely fast (low allocation overhead).
- **JSON Logs:** Higher CPU usage due to `encoding/json` overhead.
- **Recommendation:** Usage is safe for high throughput, but be aware of the serialization cost for very large JSON blobs (>1MB).

## Installation

### Docker
Get the latest lightweight image from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull thelisdeep/pii-shield:latest
```

## Configuration
See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for a full list of environment variables, including:
- `PII_SALT`: Custom HMAC salt (Required for production).
- `PII_ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD`: Enable dynamic entropy baselines.
- `PII_DISABLE_BIGRAM_CHECK`: Optimize for non-English logs.

## Quick Start
1. Test Locally (CLI)
You can pipe any log output through PII-Shield to see it in action immediately:

```bash
# Emulate a log with a sensitive password
echo "Error: User password=MySecretPass123! failed login" | docker run -i --rm thelisdeep/pii-shield:latest

# Output: Error: User password=[HIDDEN:8f3a11] failed login
```

2. Kubernetes (Sidecar Pattern)
To use PII-Shield as a pipe wrapper for your application, use an `initContainer` to copy the binary into a shared volume.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-app
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: bin-dir
    emptyDir: {}
  
  # 1. Copy the PII-Shield binary to a shared volume
  initContainers:
  - name: install-shield
    image: thelisdeep/pii-shield:latest
    command: ["cp", "/bin/pii-shield", "/opt/bin/pii-shield"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: bin-dir
      mountPath: /opt/bin

  # 2. Run your app and pipe logs through PII-Shield
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    image: my-app:1.0
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    # Pipe stderr/stdout through the sanitizer
    args: ["./start-app.sh 2>&1 | /opt/bin/pii-shield"] 
    volumeMounts:
    - name: bin-dir
      mountPath: /opt/bin
```


## Verification
This project is verified with a comprehensive suite:
1. **Unit Tests**: Cover edge cases, multilingual support, and JSON integrity.
2. **Fuzzing**: Native Go fuzzing ensures crash safety against invalid inputs.
3. **Stress Testing**: `./full_stress_test.sh` validates 100% detection accuracy on mixed workloads.
